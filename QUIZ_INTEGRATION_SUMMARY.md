## 🔄 **How the Integration Works**

### **Quiz Generation Flow**
```
1. User in AI Chat: "Generate a quiz about world history"
2. Backend detects quiz request → sets type: "quiz"
3. AI generates structured JSON quiz data
4. QuizMessage component renders interactive quiz
5. Quiz data stored in both:
   - Chat history (for AI Chat display)
   - Quiz System (for centralized management)
```

### **Quiz Taking Flow**
```
1. User clicks "Start Quiz" in chat
2. QuizMessage shows timer + progress tracking
3. User answers questions with real-time validation
4. Results calculated and displayed instantly
5. Quiz completion data synced to Quiz System
6. Option to view detailed results in Quiz System
```

### **Cross-Platform Data Sharing**
```
